# SorryBot
A bot made for sentinelcraft.net discord server that counts how many times our resident banana says sorry

create a file called config.json with this in it if you want to run it yourself

{ 
    "token"  : "this is not a real token",
    "prefix" : "+"
}

create an app on discord : https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
add a bot user and paste the token in the token field, after that do npm install, and then you can start it with node .
